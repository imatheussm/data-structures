**Data structures in Python.**

According to [the Wikipedia page on data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure), a data structure is "a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data."

In this repository, there shall be implementations of different data structures, which are made with the Python programming language. For more information on them, go to their respective folder.
