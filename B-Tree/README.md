# B-Tree

**B-Trees in Python.**

According to [the Wikipedia page on B-Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree), a B-Tree "is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time."

This data structure is a generalization of the binary search tree structure, and is well suited for systems in which large amounts of data are to be stored.
